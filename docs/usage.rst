=========

Usage is simple and options are provided::

   $ scheduler

This will list the available options that can be used to run the program.

Running the program requires a secrets.json file that is the key to a service account for the google developer console project. This is needed to allow the program to communicate with google drive. To get this setup, access needs to be granted by a system admin. Contact Nathan Silverman or Roberts Kalnins for this.
